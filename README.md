# AI Response Transformer

AI Response Transformer is a web-based tool that takes raw AI responses and converts them into clean, structured, and readable outputs with proper formatting. It supports Markdown-like syntax for headings, code blocks, emphasis, and blockquotes, allowing developers and content creators to display AI-generated content in a visually appealing way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

No special prerequisites are required. Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) can run this project.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-response-transformer.git
```

#### 1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ai-response-transformer
   ```
#### 2. Open index.html in your browser

---

### Usage

1. Type a query about AI, business, or innovation in the input field
2. Click Generate
3. The AI response will appear in a structured format below, with headings, code blocks, and blockquotes rendered properly
4. Stats cards are displayed below each response showing example Response Time and Accuracy

## Code Structure

```
ai-response-transformer/
│
├─ index.html           # Main HTML file with structure, styling, and scripts
├─ README.md            # Project documentation
└─ assets/              # Optional: for images, fonts, or other assets
```

## Key Sections in index.html

- Header: Project title and description
- Input Section: Input field and "Generate" button
- Response Section: Displays parsed AI responses
- JavaScript Functions:
  - getMockResponse(query) – Returns a sample response based on keywords
  - parseMarkdown(text) – Converts Markdown-like syntax into HTML
  - renderResponse(rawText) – Renders the parsed response along with stats cards
- Event listener for generating responses

## Markdown Support
```Markdown
Syntax Example Output
Heading 1 # Innovation <h1>Innovation</h1>
Heading 2 ## Business Growth <h2>Business Growth</h2>
Heading 3 ### AI & Technology <h3>AI & Technology</h3>
Bold **text** <strong>text</strong>
Italic *text* <em>text</em>
Inline code  `code`  <code>code</code>
Code block  ```js\nconsole.log('Hello');\n```  <pre><code>console.log('Hello');</code></pre>
Blockquote > quote <blockquote>quote</blockquote>
```
---

## Customization

- Styling: Change colors, fonts, and layout in the <style> section
- Markdown Parsing: Extend parseMarkdown() function to support more syntax
- Responses: Replace mockResponses with real API responses for production use

---

## Future Improvements

- Connect to a real AI API (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) for dynamic responses
- Add syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Make stats cards truly dynamic based on AI response time and confidence
- Add light/dark theme toggle
- Add history of previous queries
